Our plan is to make "Team 10 News" website, including 4-5 pages. Aida will be doing "Food" page, Joona will do "Entertainmet",
Jussi will do the "Weather" part and Christian will do "Sports". We all might do the main page, we will decide on that later.
The pages will include pictures, videos, articles, links and sign up forms.
